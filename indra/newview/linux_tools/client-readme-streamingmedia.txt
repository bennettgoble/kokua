Kokua - Linux Streaming Media Support README
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

WHAT IS IT?
-=-=-=-=-=-

Shared media, Media On a Prim (MOAP), Music support features allow users
on Kokua and other Second Life clients to display and listen to various
media types within Metaverse Grids. Kokua provides the opensource gstreamer
library to stream music and additional media to the user. We have chosen
use opensource solutions when possible. The Linux viewer can be compiled
with the proprietary FmodEx music streaming library and self-compliers
or welcome compile with that feature but, must obtain their own copy
of FmodEx. Also, WebKit is for some media delivery like
Youtube and other web based content.
