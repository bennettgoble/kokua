# This file is a replacement for the original LL menu_viewer (which was copied
# as menu_viewer_6_3_7) to force a merge conflict each time changes come from
# upstream
#
# Obviously this file's contents should never be changed however the merge
# conflicts will indicate what has recently changed (after the first merge
# when the whole file will flag up as different)
#
# Once incoming changes have been identified they need to be added in the 
# menu_viewer_kokua and menu_viewer_kokua_original files which are Kokua's
# actual main menu files (one for modern, one for classic)
