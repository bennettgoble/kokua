Macintosh viewer re-branding tips:

To convert ico file to icns go to http://iconverticons.com/online/
I had to be on a mac to convert from a windows ico to a icns Mac icon set file.

Thanks to David Rowe for the link.

The Brand.icns has to be copied in all the indra/newview/icon/ directories and into newview directory.
It needs to be copied to every location where secondlife.icns resides.

To get a re-branded nib file:

Copy Secondlife.xib to xxxx.xib.
Text edit the file changing Second Life to your xxxx brand.

http://www.speirs.org/blog/2007/12/5/what-are-xib-files.html

This link has instructions for a command line way to make (compile) a new re-branded nib from the just edited xxxx.xib file. 

This part from the blog is in error.
ibtool --errors --warnings --notices --output-format human-readable-text --compile your.xib output.nib 

It should be:
ibtool --errors --warnings --notices --output-format human-readable-text --compile output.nib your.xib 

With "human-readable-txt" the nnib file is not a binary file but, seems to work correctly in the viewer.

The title bar is branded by editing indra/newview/English.lproj/InfoPlist.strings

After branding as above it’s likely to result in a faulty Installer or underlying *.app. The * app’s are a build up from a unix executable file. This file can be run from the command line terminal with for example “./Kokua”. What this provides is visibility within the terminal of errors that may be hidden when running the *.app.

For example:
 /Users/bill/kokua-sl-np-fork/build-darwin-x86_64/newview/Release/Kokua.app/Contents/Resources/Kokua\ Viewer.app/contents/MacOS/Kokua  

In this context the .app files are directories.
