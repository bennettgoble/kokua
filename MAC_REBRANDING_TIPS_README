Macintosh viewer re-branding tips:

To convert ico file to icns go to http://iconverticons.com/online/
I had to be on a mac to convert from a windows ico to a icns Mac icon set file.

Thanks to David Rowe for the link.

The Brand.icns has to be copied in all the indra/newview/icon/ directories and into newview directory.
It needs to be copied to every location where secondlife.icns resides.

To get a re-branded nib file:

Copy Secondlife.xib to xxxx.xib.
Text edit the file changing Second Life to your xxxx brand.

http://www.speirs.org/blog/2007/12/5/what-are-xib-files.html

This link has instructions for a command line way to make (compile) a new re-branded nib from the just edited xxxx.xib file. 

This part from the blog is in error.
ibtool --errors --warnings --notices --output-format human-readable-text --compile your.xib output.nib 

It should be:
ibtool --errors --warnings --notices --output-format human-readable-text --compile output.nib your.xib 

With "human-readable-txt" the nob file is not a bnary file but, seems to work correctly in the viewer.

The title bar is branded by editing indra/newview/English.lproj/InfoPlist.strings
